SLAM state vector
=============================================

SLAM approaches can be classified by many criteria. Refer, for example,
to `cadena2016ppf`_ for a recent survey.

Regarding the state space representation, we find two fundamental approaches:
continuous-time SLAM (which was relatively recent), and the omnipresent
discrete-time SLAM based on only mapping some selected *Keyframes* from
the continuous stream of sensory data.
